      <h1>About Me</h1>
       <p>
  I completed my Bachelor of Engineering in Information Technology from a reputed institute with a strong CGPA of 8.78 (2020â€“2024). Prior to that, I pursued my Higher Secondary Education (HSC) with 63.69% in June 2020, and Secondary School Certification (SSC) with a commendable 89.40% in May 2018. My academic journey has shaped my logical thinking, technical foundation, and discipline, which continue to support my web development career.
