    <h3>Employee Management System</h3>
    <p>
      This desktop-based Java project is designed to manage employee data efficiently. It covers functionalities such as adding new employees, updating records, and deleting entries for those who leave the organization.
    </p>
    <p>
      The system ensures that all employee records—such as name, department, role, and status—are stored and retrieved from a MySQL database. It offers a clean GUI using Java Swing and AWT, making it easy for HR personnel to use.
    </p>
    <p>
      This system is ideal for small to mid-sized companies looking to centralize their HR data. It demonstrates core Java concepts such as OOPs, exception handling, and database connectivity using JDBC.
